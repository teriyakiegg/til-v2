Sharing a link? Skip to the good part.
Try “Copy link to highlight” when sharing links. When a recipient opens your link, it will send them right to the part of the page you selected, instead of the top of the page.

Highlight the text you want to share.
Right-click and select Copy link to highlight.
Paste the link anywhere, like an email or message thread.

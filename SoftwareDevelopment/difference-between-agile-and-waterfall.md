# Difference between agile and waterfall

## agile
- Time and Cost are fixed.
- Agile methodology is increamental and iterative.
- Requirements are expected to change and changes are incorporated at any point.
- Working model is delivered during initial phases and successive iteration of the model are delivered to the client for feedback.
- Scaling up of products is easy because of the iterative approach.
- Frequent customer interaction and feedbacks are involved in agile methodology.
- In agile documentation is often negelected and a working prototype serves as basis for customer's evaluation and feedback.
- Continous testing is performed during each iteration.

## waterfall
- Scope is fixed
- Waterfall methodology is sequential and linear.
- Requirements have to be freezed at the beginning of SDLC.
- Working model of software is delivered at the later phases of SDLC.
- It is difficult to scale-up projects based on waterfall methodology.
- Customers or end user doesn't have a say after the requirements are freezed during the initial phases. They only get to know the product once it is build completely.
- Waterfall requires formalized documentations.
- Testing is performed once the software is build.

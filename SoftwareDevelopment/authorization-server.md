# authorization server
Authorization Server is the Application for issuing the OAuth Client tokens which allows access to the data on the Resource Server on behalf of Resource Owner.  
Typically the Authorization Server could also be an Identity Provider (IDP) though there is no reason that they could not be separate servers.
